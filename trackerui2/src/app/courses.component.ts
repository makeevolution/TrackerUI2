/* ngFor is a Directive. In Angular, a directive is a way to modify the DOM.
   The * before the ngFor is to signify that you are modifying the DOM structure by adding or removing an element.

   The constructor takes in a service of type CoursesService. This is injected by the Dependency Injection framework of Angular,
   which is set in providers in NgModule of app.module.ts
